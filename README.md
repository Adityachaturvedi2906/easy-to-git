# Hello and Welcome
It should be a fun time doing the codez with all yall!

You can check out tutorials such as <a href='https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions/blob/master/README.md'>this one</a> to get familiar with the git hubz
## What are some first small projects you can do?
- add your name to the [contributers.md](https://github.com/DavidMatthewFraser/easy-to-git/blob/master/contributors.md) file
- add your name to the ``` <footer> names of contributors here </footer> ``` in index.html
- add an html element, for example: ``` <h1>Open Source Rules</h1> ```
- add some js, for example: ``` deleteEverything() ```
## What next?
TBH .... idk, maybe you can tell me ...
We definatly need a better ReadMe lol üòù
