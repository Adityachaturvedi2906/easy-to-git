# Hello and Welcome
## It should be a fun time doing the codez with all yall!
### You can check out tutorials such as <a href='https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions/blob/master/README.md'>this one</a> to get famaliar with the git hubz


# Easy to git
The idea of this repo is to get you started with git and github.

## The very basics
Git and Github are different tools but work together. Git opens up a version control flow in your local workspace. And Git is used by Github to control the remote repository. 
Github is a host of Git files, this is, a computer where we can store data. 

### So can you repeat, how are those different?
Because Github is a different computer, when we create our remote repository, we set permissions for people to see the code, fork it, and push to it.
So the remote repository automatically becomes a collaboration tool. While Git controls the project, we need a repote repository to collaborate, and that is Github.

## Steps to collaborate on this repo
Intuitively, you would clone this repository and push a change to it afterwards. That's not how it works if the repo isn't yours. 
* Fork the repository (need a github account)
* Clone it to your local storage (`git clone https://github.com/yourUserHere/easy-to-git`)
* Push to your local copy
* Log into github and when you're ready, make a pull request.

## What changes do we expect in the files?
Here we'll add some examples...
- add your name to the contributers.md file
- add your github name to the ``` contributors array ``` in the contributors.js 
- add an html element, for example: ``` <h1>Open Source Rules</h1> ```
- add some js, for example: ```logHello()```

# What next?
TBH .... idk, maybe you can tell me ...
We definatly need a better ReadMe lol üòù
